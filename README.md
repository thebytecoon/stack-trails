This repo is a personal exploratory project for testing multiples "fullstack web frameworks" from multiples languages, and experience what they have to offer from a Laravel Developer perspective.

My main goal is compare the features of each framework with Laravel, and see how they differ in terms of syntax, structure, and overall experience.

## Rules
- I will compare all the default features of the frameworks with that all features that came as default in Laravel.
- All frameworks must be "fullstack", that mean: they have to have some kind of ORM, routing, templating, testing framework, and a some form of folder structure, etc.
- I will use the minimal number of external packages as possible.
- I will use SQLite as the main database for all the frameworks.
- I will use the same database schema for all the frameworks.
- I will use the same base HTML template for all the frameworks.
- I will use TailwindCSS.
- All the sites must have the same functionality.
- I will use Docker and docker compose for all the frameworks.
- I will not compare performance, security or deploy process since they are out of the scope of this project.
- Remember, this is a personal exploratory project from a Laravel developer perspective.

## Features to compare

- Routing: how to define routers and handle basic parameters, query strings, and some form of middlewares.
- Database: how to define migrations, relationships, and how to use the ORM.
- Templating: how to define views, layouts, and how to use the templating engine.
- Authentication: how to define authentication, registration, and password reset.
- Storage: how to define file storage, and how to use the storage system.
- Events: how to define events and listeners.
- Mail: how to define mail and notifications.
- Queues: some form of queues workers.
- Validation: how to define form validation rules and how to use them.

## Extra features to compare

- Assets: does it have a built-in asset manager and came with a build system?
- Console: Does it have a built-in console and how to define commands and and execute queries from the console?
- Debugging: Some basic debugging tools.
- Testing: how to define tests and how to run them.
